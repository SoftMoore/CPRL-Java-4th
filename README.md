[*Compiler Design Using Java&reg;: An Object-Oriented Approach* (Fourth Edition)](https://shop.ingramspark.com/b/084?fCF6byedMYiVeq7pkgBXIolmwhBXHWSPGiQjiC3O1Ta)
by John I. Moore, Jr.  The book covers implementation of a compiler for CPRL (Compiler PRoject Language),
a programming language designed for teaching the basics of compiler construction.  CPRL includes
variables, statements, expressions, arrays, records, and subprograms.  The target language for the
compiler is assembly language for the CPRL Virtual Machine (CVM), a virtual machine with a stack-based
architecture that is similar to but much simpler than the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  Organization of
the compiler project is described in Appendix A.

The following sections from the book are provided as PDF documents in the `Book` folder.
